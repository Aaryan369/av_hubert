<p>
4. DISCLAIMERS
</p>

<p>
THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS” WITH NO
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. META EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, CUSTOM,
USAGE OR OTHERWISE AS TO ANY MATTERS RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR
LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF META HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, THEIR CONSTITUENT COMPONENTS, AND ANY OUTPUT
(COLLECTIVELY, “SOFTWARE MATERIALS”) ARE NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN
ANY APPLICATION OR SITUATION WHERE FAILURE OR FAULT OF THE SOFTWARE MATERIALS

APPROPRIATE DECISION-MAKING AND RISK-MITIGATION PROCEDURES AND POLICIES IN
CONNECTION WITH A HIGH-RISK USE SUCH THAT EVEN IF THERE IS A FAILURE OR FAULT
IN ANY OF THE SOFTWARE MATERIALS, THE SAFETY OF PERSONS OR PROPERTY AFFECTED BY
THE ACTIVITY STAYS AT A LEVEL THAT IS REASONABLE, APPROPRIATE, AND LAWFUL FOR
THE FIELD OF THE HIGH-RISK USE.
</p>

your use of or interaction with any Third Party Materials are solely between
you and the third party. Meta does not control or endorse, and makes no

<p>
9. APPLICABLE LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION
</p>

<p>

each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.
</p>

<p>
10. MISCELLANEOUS
</p>

<p>
If any provision or part of a provision of this License is unlawful, void or
unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severed from
this License, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any
remaining provisions. The failure of Meta to exercise or enforce any right or
provision of this License will not operate as a waiver of such right or
provision. This License does not confer any third-party beneficiary rights upon
any other person or entity. This License, together with the Documentation,
contains the entire understanding between you and Meta regarding the subject
matter of this License, and supersedes all other written or oral agreements and
